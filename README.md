# flutter_redux_cascading_select

Flutter application that implements Redux and cascading selections.

In this application I created a Redux structure and a Redux component implementing the cascading
selection logic. 

Following the pattern that I built in this project it is possible to reuse the Redux
component, in this case it is a DropDown but you can change the type of component and reuse the 
logic, in order to implement the complex logic that is hidden behind the multi-cascading selections.

This is the perfect approach to all those cases where there are relationships between data anytime 
that the user must choice consequential data because any choice influences the next set of data in 
the order of cascading selection. 

In the example you have this structure:

Category
SubCategory
Product

The choice of a Category influences the set of subcategories that the user can choose and the choice
of a SubCategory influences the set of products that the user can choose.

Thanks for the support and for the debugging!
